## Feeback and Nitpicks welcome!

Do you see an egregious crime against your language of choice committed
somewhere in this repo? Is there something in here that would raise
serious concerns if it showed up in a pull request in one of your
codebases? Let me know!

I accept all forms of feedback, from multi-page treatises on programming
language theory to tweets that say "Don't do this" with a file and line
number. Any and all help is thoroughly appreciated.
